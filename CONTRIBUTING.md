## ✨ How you can contribute

We value contributions and we provide the most active and constant contributors with public recognition, maintainer status and hardware goodies. If you are willing to contribute to our [GitHub](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio) Repositories, please contribute in the following way:

- Triage open issues: try to reproduce issues reported by other users and confirm whether you can experience them as well, or ask users for more details if needed. Spot duplicates. Improve descriptions. Help users who ask for support.
- Submit fixes and implementations: pick an open issue or feature request that you think you can implement yourself, and submit a pull request with an implementation.
- Test open pull requests: try to run the proposed modifications and report your success or failure. Testing on real hardware takes time and any help in this will speed up our responsiveness in merging contributions.
- Help others contribute by reviewing their code and suggesting good ways to implement fixes and features.
- Write documentation and improve the existing content.
